## Mini Project Descriptions
### Mini Project 1 (Logic_Formula_Single_Hidden_Layer)
- Finding the probability distribution of a network with a number of neurons.
- Building a neural network to perform a simple logic formula.
- Building a single layer perceptron to learn the representations of letters in the alphabet.
- Implemented with MATLAB

### Mini Project 2 (MSE_Binary_Classification_NLP)
- Proving the solution of mean squared error loss.
- Design and implement a neural network from scratch, and train it for a binary classification (car vs cat) problem.
- Implement a neural network that predicts the fourth word given the initial three. A simple NLP application.
- Implemented with MATLAB

### Mini Project 3 (Sparse_Autoencoders_CNN_L2Reg_KLDiv)
- Unsupervised feature extraction using a sparse auto-encoders. MSE loss function with the addition of Tikhonov (L2) regularization and KL-Divergence to ensure sparsity.
- Observation and completion of networks about CNNs, PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- Implemented both with MATLAB and Python (Jupyter Notebook)
